# rust-lib-and-bin

![Rust build badge](https://github.com/digikata/rust-lib-and-bin/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

Simple rust project the builds a library and binary
includes some reference project setup patterns including:
- various module imports
- pulling in compile time version strings from the manifest

## version 0.3
revised to rust 2021, also rearranged a bit to separate library portion.

For a larger project, needing independent modular crates
consider a workspace arrangement like:

## version 0.2
update this very old reference project to rust 2018

A good cargo reference for project layout is here:
